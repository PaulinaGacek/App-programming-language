## Language description
APP is a simple imperative language modeled on Logo language, where object is controlled by the forces 
applied to it. The language will allow you to create many objects that will collide with each other in 
a perfectly elastic manner.

## Motivation
We wanted to create language that would allow the user to create physical simulations in a simple and 
intuitive way.

It's especially useful for people who want to visualize their physics
tasks to better understand how forces affects on object and also predict the result they will get after applying the 
given sequence of forces to the object.
